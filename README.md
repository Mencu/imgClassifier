# imgClassifier

A basic 2D image classifier. 

Used framework is tensorflow. 

The model is applied to images from the PatchCamelyon (PCam) to identify tumors on lymph nodes.
Dataset: https://github.com/basveeling/pcam

Description: "he PatchCamelyon benchmark is a new and challenging image classification dataset. It consists of 327.680 color images (96 x 96px) extracted from histopathologic scans of lymph node sections. Each image is annoted with a binary label indicating presence of metastatic tissue. PCam provides a new benchmark for machine learning models: bigger than CIFAR10, smaller than Imagenet, trainable on a single GPU."
